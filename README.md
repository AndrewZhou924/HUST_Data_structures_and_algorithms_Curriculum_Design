## Curriculum Design of 2018 Data structures and algorithms

- author : zhanke zhou (andrew)
- topic   : study the graph isomorphism problem through machine learning as well as neural network
- how to run
  - before run , please make sure the environment is prepared : `python3.6` `NetworkX 1.6` `sklearn` `keras`
  - cd src/scripts/model
    - `python3 navie_model.py` to run the logistic regression and get result
    - `python3 navie_nn_model.py` to run the neural network and get result
- the result
  - 300 12-node graph pairs 
    - Logistic Regression :85.0%
    - Neural Network : 99.9% 

- PS

  please the version of your `NetworkX` is under 1.6
